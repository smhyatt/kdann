\subsection{Acknowledgement}

6. I would appreciate if you write a short acknowledgment section in which you do not need
to thank me, but to acknowledge my intelectual property of some of the key ideas
presented in this work, including the tree construction by padding that allows regular nested
parallelism, optimized tree traversal where the stack is one integer and involves all medians
rather then only the current one, etc.   This will not negatively affect your grade in any way.
