\subsection{Acknowledgements}

% 6. I would appreciate if you write a short acknowledgment section in which you do not need
% to thank me, but to acknowledge my intelectual property of some of the key ideas
% presented in this work, including the tree construction by padding that allows regular nested
% parallelism, optimized tree traversal where the stack is one integer and involves all medians
% rather then only the current one, etc.   This will not negatively affect your grade in any way.

Acknowledgements go to Cosmin Oancea for his contribution with some of the following key ideas used in this project. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Constructing the tree with padding, allowing regular nested parallelism. 
\item Optimising the tree traversal, such that the stack is represented as one integer.
\item Optimising the tree traversal to check all dimensions, rather than one, resulting in fewer traversals due to the increased accuracy. 
\end{itemize}

Additional acknowledgements go to Fabian Gieseke for providing a full Python implementation of approximate nearest-neighbours computations using propagation-assisted k-d trees, on two images.
