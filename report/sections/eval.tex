\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
% Validate the claims that you have done in 3. and introduction.

% Here you think what you need to demonstrate and how to best demonstrate it
% (what kind of graphs, tables, etc are needed). You can do the experimental evaluation
% (i.e., running/benchmarking the futhark programs and gathering performance data)
% at this point, once you put some though into what this should be.

% - The full brute force
% - Implementation with slow brute force
% - Implementation with fast brute force
% - Implementation with fast brute force and merge sort
% - Implementation with fast brute force and radix sort
% - Implementation with fast brute force, radix sort and partition
% - Implementation with fast brute force, radix sort, partition and fixed traversal
% - Implementation with fast brute force, radix sort and leaf sort
% - Implementation with fast brute force, radix sort, leaf sort and fixed traversal















% The height of the tree, which dictates the number of points per leaf (?)  you need to say something about it, such as that you have run ample experiments that would take too much space to present and they indicate it is about 256 points per leaf

% Get a smallish starting point like m=100000 and then increase 400000 , 800000, 1.2mil, 1.6 mil, 2mil, 4mil, ... until it still takes reasonable time to compute.

% With high dimensionality, for large k you will wait for ages because itâ€™s going to visit all leaves, so maybe 1, 3, 5, 7, 17 (the last one will take a while)

% Maybe d=1, 4, 6, 8, 11, 16
