\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
Validate the claims that you have done in 3. and introduction.

Here you think what you need to demonstrate and how to best demonstrate it
(what kind of graphs, tables, etc are needed). You can do the experimental evaluation
(i.e., running/benchmarking the futhark programs and gathering performance data)
at this point, once you put some though into what this should be.
