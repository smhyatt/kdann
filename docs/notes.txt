Q: 
- What is the point of what we are doing with these images? What data are we using, is there a purpose? 

- Why do we decompose the images to 5x5 patches, more specifically why that size patch? 

- What is m based on? the choice of m 

- Can you explain step 4 again? and why it is akin to the locality principle? 

- Is the difference between propagated or not propagated that it is balanced / uses median and not? 



Plan for progress: 


Q: 
- We want the whole thing i futhark or do we keep and combine py and fut?
- Can you really translate a py program to fut using fut? 
- You said we would use futhark and cuda, can you elaborate? 
- What structure do you want and what would you recommend I start doing?
